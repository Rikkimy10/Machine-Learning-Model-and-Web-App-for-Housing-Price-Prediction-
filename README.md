# Machine-Learning-Model-and-Web-App-for-Housing-Price-Prediction-


Developed a linear regression model to predict housing prices, applying data preprocessing techniques like feature engineering, outlier removal, and encoding of categorical variables to enhance model accuracy.

Optimized the model using hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation. Integrated the model into a web application, allowing users to input property details and receive real-time price predictions. 

Created a user-friendly interface with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Flask, showcasing expertise in machine learning, model deployment, and web development for practical applications.
